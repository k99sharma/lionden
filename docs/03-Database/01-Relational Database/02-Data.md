# What is Data?

- In computing, data is information that has been translated into a form that is efficient for processing.

- Data is information converted into **binary digital** form.

- **Raw data** is a term used to describe data in its most basic digital format.

## How data is stored

- Computers represent data, including video, images, sounds and text, as binary values using patterns of just two numbers: 1 and 0.

- A **bit** is smallest unit of data, represents just a single value. 

$$
    1 byte = 8 bits
$$

- Storage and memory is measured in megabytes and gigabytes. The amount of data collected and stored grows. The new term **brontobyte**, is data storage that is equal to 10 to the 27th power of bytes.

## Types of data

- Growth in digital environment over past decade led to a surge in digital data creation. Data now includes text, audio and video information.

- Most of the data is unstructured in form.

- The term **Big Data** is used to describe data in *petabyte* range or larger. We can understand Big Data with **3Vs** - Volume, Variety and Velocity.

## Difference between Data and Information

| Data | Information|
| --- | --- |
| It is collection of facts. | It puts facts into context. |
| Data is raw and unorganized. | Information is organized. |
| Data points are individual and sometimes unrelated. | Information maps out that data to provide a big-picutre view of how it all fits together. |
| Data does not depend on information. | Information depends on data. |
| Data comes in the form of graphs, numbers, figures, or statistics. | Information is presented through words, language, thoughts, and ideas. |


## Example of Data vs Information

- At a restraunt, a single customer's bill amount is data. However, when the restraunt owners collect and interpret multiple bills over a range of time, they can provide valuable information, such as what menu is popular and whether the prices are sufficient to cover supplies, overhead, and wages.

- A customer's response to an individual customer service survey is a point of data. But when you compile that customer's responses over time, you develop an insights around areas for improvement within your customer service team.

- The number of likes on a social media post is a single point of data. When that's combined with other social media engagement statistics, like followers, comments, and shares, a company can intuit which social media platforms perform the best and which platforms they should focus on to more effectively engage their audience.
