# What is Database?

- A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.

- A database is usually controlled by a DBMS.

- Together, **the data and the DBMS**, along with the applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a database system or just database.

- Most common types of databases you can find is modeled in rows and columns in a series of tables to make processing and querying of data efficient.

- The data can be easily accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled, and organized. Most databases use **Structured Query Language (SQL)** for writing and querying query.

## What is Structured Query Language (SQL)?

- SQL is a programming language used by all **relational databases** to query, manipulate, and define data, and to provide access control.

- SQL was developed at IBM in 1970s with Oracle as major contributor.

## Database Evolution

- Database has evolved from the early 1960s.

- Navigational databases such as hierarchial databases, and network database were the original systems used to store and manipulate data.

- In 1980s, relational databases became popular, followed by object-oriented databases in the 1990s.

- Most recently, NoSQL databases became popular for faster speed and processing of unstructured data.

- Cloud databases and self-driving databases, are new ground-breaking databases to emerge. For example, Peloton. 

- A self-driving DBMS is a system capable of collecting its own statistics and workload logs and use it to optimize itself.

## Difference between Database and Spreadsheet

| Database | Spreadsheet |
| --- | --- |
| Databases allow multiple users at the same time to quickly and securely access and query the data using highly complex logic and language. | Spreadsheets were originally designed for one user. They're great for a single user or a small number of users who don't need to do a lot of incredibly complicated data manipulation. |
| Example of databases are RDBMS, NoSQL, etc. | Example of Spreedsheet is Microsoft Excel. |


## Types of Database

There are many different types of database. Best database to use depends upon types of data.

### Relational Databases

- Items in relational database are organized as a set of tables with columns and rows.

- It provides most efficient and flexible way to access structured information.

### Object-Oriented Databases
 
- Information is provided in the form of objects, as in object-oriented programming.

### Distributed Databases

- A distributed databases consists of two or more files located in different sites.

- The database may be stored on multiple computers, located in the same physical location, or over different networks.

### Data Warehouses

- A central repository for data, a data warehouse is a type of database specifically designed for fast query and analysis.

### NoSQL Databases

- A NoSQL, or non-relational database, allows unstructued and semistructured data to be stored and manipulated.

- NoSQL databases grew popular as web development demands increase.

### Graph Databases

- A graph database stores data in term of entities and relationships between entities.

- **OLTP databases** is a speedy, analytic database designed for large numbers of transactions performed by multiple users.

### Open Source Databases

- It is one whose source code is open source, such database could be SQL or NoSQL databases.

### Cloud Databases

- It is a collection of data, either structured or unstructured that resides on a private, public, or hybrid cloud computing platform.

- There are two types of cloud database models: traditional and databases as a service (DBaaS).

- Administrative tasks and maintenance are performed by a service provider.

### Multimodel Databases

- Multimodel databases combine different types of database model into a single, integrated back end.

### Document/JSON Databases

- Designed for storing, retrieving, and managing documnent-oriented information, document databases are a modern way to store data in JSON format rather than rows and columns.


## Database Challenges

- Absorbing significant increases in data volume.

- Ensuring data security.

- Keeping up with demand.

- Managing and maintaining the database and infrastructure.

- Removing limits on scalability.

- Ensuring data residency, data sovereignty or latency requirements.
